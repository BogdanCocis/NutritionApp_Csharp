Title of the project: NutrițiePlus - Personal Nutrition Management Platform

Project Description:
NutrițiePlus is an innovative platform that combines a web service and a Windows Form desktop application, offering users the ability to manage and monitor their personal nutrition. Developed in ASP.NET, the web service provides access to a comprehensive database, created using Microsoft SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS), ensuring a robust and efficient structure for data storage and management.

Key features of NutrițiePlus include:

1. Secure Authentication: Existing users can authenticate using their email address and associated password from the database. Authentication is secure to ensure the confidentiality of user data.

2. Food Management: The platform provides a comprehensive database with information about foods, including the name of the food, number of calories, and macronutrients. Users can search, add, and delete foods from the database, as well as update information about them.

3. Caloric Consumption Monitoring: Users can record the foods consumed during the day, and NutrițiePlus automatically calculates the daily caloric requirement based on the user's profile and the recorded foods.

5. Ideal Weight and BMI Calculation: NutrițiePlus offers functionalities for calculating ideal weight and Body Mass Index (BMI), helping users monitor their progress towards their health goals.

6. User-Friendly Desktop Interface: The Windows Form desktop application provides an intuitive and easy-to-use graphical interface, allowing users to navigate easily and utilize all NutrițiePlus features.
